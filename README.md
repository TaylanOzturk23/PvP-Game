                 Otherwise, your skills may not be recorded.
                 
                --> The Logic of the game:
                 There are 100 stages in this game and you are tryna reach till to the last stage.
                 You fight with an enemy in every stages. You must kill them to transitioning to a next stage.
                 Everyone has some skills to beat each other. 
                 So, you have skills too. You and other enemies are  needing skill points to upgrade a skill.
                 You must transition to a next stage to get more skill points.
                 There are some bosses in this game.
                 Masters (M) and Grandmasters (GM). GMs are more powerful.
                 
                 Masters are coming in these stages :
                 print(list(filter(lambda x: True if x % 5 == 0 and not x % 2 == 0 else False, range(1, 100+1))))
                 
                 Grandmasters are coming in these stages:
                 print(list(filter(lambda x: False if x % 10 else True, range(1, 100+1))))
                 
                 And here are some attack styles. Magical and physical attack styles.
                 Magical attacks are more effective than physical attacks. 
                 But magical attack's accuracy is lower.
                 
                 
                 --> TIP:   
                 It is recommended to upgrade physical damage in the early stages, 
                 and it is recommended to use one of the attack styles, the "quick" style. 
                 Because the magic damage in the early stages is unlikely to be accurate.
                 Likewise, "powerful" and "critical" attack styles are unlikely to be accurate.
                 So it is recommended to be prone to physical damage in the early stages and 
                 to use the "quick" style heavily.
